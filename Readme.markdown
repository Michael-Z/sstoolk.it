This is the website for [SSToolkit](http://github.com/samsoffes/sstoolkit). Some fun toys include [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), [Compass](http://github.com/chriseppstein/compass), and [Sinatra](http://github.com/sinatra/sinatra).

## Running Locally

You will need to install [Bundler](http://gembundler.com) (if you haven't already) and all the necessary gems. You can install it by running the following:

    $ gem install bundler --version '>= 1.0.0'
    $ bundle install

Now the following command to start the server and you're good to go.

    $ rake server

Enjoy.
